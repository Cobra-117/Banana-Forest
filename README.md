This is the WebGl branch, allowing the game to run directly on web browser

## How to play?

To destroy the bulldozers, you have to place defenses by dragging and dropping them on any grass tile.  There are several bulldozers and defenses types, described in the how to play menu of the game. 

Each time an bulldozer reach the end of the map, you loose a life, when your life reach 0, it's Game Over!
